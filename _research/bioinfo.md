By integrating multiple layers of high-throughput data with a strong knowledge of tumor biology we build hypotheses that can be tested using molecular biology methods. We are continuously developing and improving methods for analysis of deregulated signaling pathways in cancer by merging mutational, copy-number, gene expression, and quantitative proteomics data. We also have extensive experience in developing tools and pipelines for the analysis of microarray and Next-Generation Sequencing transcriptome and genome data. We are applying our developed methods to study human breast cancer subtypes as well as tumor development in mouse models of human cancer. We also have a strong focus on developing methods for rational selection of treatment for cancer patients based on tumor omic and phenotypic features.
